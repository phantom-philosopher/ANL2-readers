    "A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, mutable, and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly braces, and they have keys and values.  To summarize, a dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs (a.k.a. items). Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. \n",
