    "#### Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is a method to address problems where the solution depends on _simpler_ instances of the original problem.  The simplest instances of the problem are called the _base cases_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by writing a _recursive_ function for this problem: a function that (directly or indirectly) calls _itself_ at some point.\n",
    "It is important to also treat the base case in a recursive function, for otherwise it would keep calling itself indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fibonacci\n",
    "The archetypical example of a recursively defined sequence in mathematics is the **Fibonacci** sequence.\n",
    "It is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_1 = 1,\\quad F_2 = 1,\\quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This means that, after the first two terms, every term can be computed by adding the previous 2 terms.\n",
    "The base cases here are $F_1=1$, $F_2=1$, and the recursion is $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$: \n",
    "it expresses $F_n$ using terms of _smaller_ index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a table containing the first few values:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array} {|r|r|}\\hline n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ \n",
    "\\hline F_n & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 & 21 & 34 & 55 & 89 & 144 \\\\ \\hline  \\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We may even use the recursion to extend the sequence to the left.\n",
    "What we then get is: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_0 = 0,\\quad F_{-1} = 1,\\quad F_{-2} = -1,\\quad F_{-3} = 2, \\quad F_{-4} = -3, \\quad F_{-5} = 5,\\quad\\ldots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "But we shall mainly focus on terms of positive index (and sometimes 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we shall explore several Python implementations that can be used to compute $F_n$.\n",
